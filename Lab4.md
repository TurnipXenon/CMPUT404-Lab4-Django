## Question 4

Django migration allows models to be represented into your database. You need to do
this whenever any changes are made to your models, so that the database reflects
the changes you made to your code.

## Question 5

The DJando admin site shows authentication related entries, like users, such as
the current super user. It also shows the models under the polls app. You can get
a custom model to show up in the Django admin page by registering it to the admin
site in `admin.py`.
